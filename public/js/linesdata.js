        title: "2268",
        designers: "Hamza Qureshi, Anny Fan",
        description: "The year 2268 marks two hundred and fifty years after this year’s Lunar Gala. After centuries of disastrous climate change, where rapid urbanization and pollution have distorted how we approach growth in an urban landscape, where do we stand? 2268 explores this inquisition from two perspectives. The first perspective captures extreme pollution and the second perspective captures sustainability to the extreme -- where urbanization has gotten out of control and the soil has become rotten, forcing us to carry the food we need to eat."

        title: "amzu",
        designers: "Amber Lee, Kazumi Kanagawa, Ty Van de Zande",
        description: "Fashion often emphasizes aesthetic over utility. Inspired by Errolson Hugh’s “smart” and flexible ACRONYM 2014 S/S collection, this line explores the gap between clothing and technology through garments that utilize transformative elements to adapt to its wearers’ needs and environments. The line features print lights, a printed circuitry for integrating light into fabrics, developed by design student Ty Van de Zande."

        title: "Chinoiseries",
        designers: "Gunn Chaiyapatranun, Fon Euchukanonchai, Shariwa Sharada",
        description: "Modern, playful, but dignified. Harking back to centuries of tradition, Chinoiseries reintroduces traditional clothing of asian cultures through its marriage with western references, materials and modern technology. The white and blue of Chinoiserie porcelain like delftware set the color scheme fpr this line, with different shades of denim representing the blue paired with white textiles of different weights and opacities."

        title: "Chroma",
        designers: "Brandon Darreff, Zain Islam-Hashmi, Alina Kramkova",
        description: "Chroma injects color into our sterilized environments. Rigid structures drip over the form, bending fluorescent matter to the wearer’s will. Accentuating confidence and augmenting the body, Chroma is true eye candy."
    },
    {
        title: "Descent",
        designers: "Nana Cheon",
        description: "Inspired by wedding costumes around the world, Descent challenges gender norms and identity through amorphous, androgynous, and anonymous designs. The garments will exaggerate and reshape the body in a way that obscures and mystifies the gender of the wearer. In the end, however, gender is a construct and all variations of identity can be appreciated and admired."
    },
    {
        title: "Escape",
        designers: "Yirui Zhu, Zhuona Ma",
        description: "Inspired by the life story of the famous French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Gauguin, Escape explores the tension between social constraints and personal pursuits. Macrame, representing tension, demonstrates a process in which the person breaks certain boundaries to achieve what is truly desired. Its functionality evolves from restraining the motion of people to extending out from the human body as a sign of passion and determination."

    {
        title: "Homeostasis",
        designers: "Jack Forman, Alan Guo, Mohan Yeh (Morphing Matter Lab - CMU HCII)",
        description: "Homeostasis is the realization of the Morphing Matter Lab’s exploration of the intersection of academics and aesthetics. Novel research and development of the shape-memory and conductive properties of twisted-then-coiled silver-coated nylon muscles allows for the fruition of autonomously responsive textiles. From the equilibrium between microscopic technology and macroscopic design, Homeostasis pulls at the minimal and organic forms of the human body as inspiration for a line in which every piece is a living and breathing display of its own. To evoke and enlighten the audience, we defy the expectation that fashion must be a static display, and engage the capabilities of futuristic textiles to execute striking metamorphoses in the moment. Vent. Twist. Spin. Lift."
    },
    {
        title: "HOOKED",
        designers: "Lily Fulop",
        description: "HOOKED explores the idea of absurdity and impracticality in fashion. In this line, current fashion trends and traditional yarncraft methods are taken to the extreme through the juxtaposition of incongruous textiles. HOOKED straddles the line between sculpture and apparel to create an irreverent celebration of textiles and high fashion."

    {
        title: "Inertia",
        designers: "Sherry Wu, Annie Huang",
        description: "Inertia is a collection based on an imaginary future society in which people refuse to change. The pieces are uniforms for the inhabitants of this alternative future, which implies a sense of “fashion communism” and their core value for efficiency. In each piece, a flowy material is contained by a stiff fabric (patent leather or denim), to show the oppression from the society. In addition, to embody the value of efficiency, the tailoring process of every piece is zero-waste."
    },
    {
        title: "Intrepid",
        designers: "Jules Przybylska",
        description: "Intrepid utilizes perspective points highlighting and complementing the female form showing her boldness and strength. The designs emphasize the features of the body in a way that portrays the model in a position of power. In the past women have been subject to criticism based on how they presented themselves. This clothing line takes on a different side showing the power that the female form symbolizes."
    },
    {
        title: "Maille",
        designers: "Noa Wolff-Fineout",
        description: "Maille is derived from the word chain mail, a reflection of its medieval and baroque influences. The collection explores the deconstruction of rigid armor facades, juxtaposing these strong forms against their raw scaffolding. Diaphanous material is intricately conformed to strict structural material, entirely exposing the form underneath. The body is protected only by discrete quilted encasings whose utility contrasts its scintillating delicate quality."

    {
        title: "Messiah",
        designers: "Lanre Adetola",
        description: "Messiah is a visualization of the quest for liberation and cultural connection across the African diaspora. From the words of Kwame Nkrumah to the bandoliers of the Black Panther Party to the Jagged Lines of the Africobra Art Movement to the militaristic uprising of Thomas Sankara’s Burkina Faso, I aim to forge links through a new found visual language that unites people of African heritage both here and abroad. This is the work of Pan Africanism. Thus, this is a Pan-African collection. All black, beads/shells from both the Yoruba and Harlem girl’s hair, patterned faux leathers, military vest with jewels and floral lace linings all coalesce on the bodies of free, sensual black men. Black freedom, transgression, and unity reimagined."

    {
        title: "mien",
        designers: "Bernice Yu",
        description: "mien considers the human being’s obsession with the face as a frame for personal expression, enshrines the neurotic self, and attempts to reunite the internal and abstract self with the external and physical body-vehicle. Through the use of head-pieces, proportion, and silhouettes, the relationships between face (abstract self) and body (flesh and bone) will be explored, from the dysmorphic and disassociative to, eventually, euphoric and balanced."
    },
    {
        title: "Morfologia",
        designers: "SooJin Sohn, Tatyana Mustakos",
        description: "Morfologia is about shape; it is about the evolution of form within the complex web of biological, social, and technological dependencies that ensnare every article of clothing. Through a combination of visceral texture, mechanical augmentation, and interactive textiles, Morfologia looks at the way human bodies are altered, augmented, and obfuscated, as well as what they do to fight back."

    {
        title: "Nightmare",
        designers: "Krista Wilhelm",
        description: "Inspired by bold, virtuous angels being pulled into the dark side of their minds, Nightmare uses sheer and silk sateen fabrics showcasing sexual, yet elegant sensations in the form of evening gowns. Also incorporated are feathered materials inspired by angel’s wings, hand beadwork and hand-crafted floral cutouts. Nightmare was created for women who love to walk in a room and have all eyes fixated on them."
    },
    {
        title: "Stack",
        designers: "Sebastian Carpenter",
        description: "Stack explores the intersection of the organic and the inorganic. Nearly every stage of the line’s production is inorganic in some way—from the materials (sheets of foamboard and plastic), to the use of digital fabrication methods, to the arrangement of each piece’s components in a equidistant stack. Despite the methods of the line’s creation, each resulting look takes on an organic form, making a nod to the natural origins of most manufactured objects."
    },
    {
        title: "SURFACE",
        designers: "Michael Powell, Selena Zhen",
        description: "SURFACE explores the issue of the distortion and trivialization of the human body into objects of desire. The veneer of mesh, overlayed with cut contours, is a constructed external appearance that illustrates areas of the socially ideal body, exposing those who wear it to appreciation and admiration, but also leaving them vulnerable to objectification. As the line progresses, the body becomes more clearly exposed than upon first impression. It is meant to represent an exaggerated set of physical attributes that emphasize the scrutiny of our bodies – conscious and subconscious, external and internal."
    },
    {
        title: "Tambora",
        designers: "Briana Green",
        description: "Style, confidence, and a voice for those unafraid to step out of their shells, Tambora proves that there is not a single, but multiple depictions of what a beautiful woman is. The collection is inspired by the designer’s greatest influence, her great grandmother, who spent her days crocheting and sewing garments of her own and always dressed with poise and grace."
    },
    {
        title: "Travaille",
        designers: "Ava Kling",
        description: "Travaille, the French word for “work”, uses the semiotics of traditional men’s workwear, ranging from utilitarian, blue collar silhouettes, to the structure and refinement of white collar leisure apparel. From this foundation, the collection works to deconstruct and transform the definition of menswear as a gendered constraint. These traditional uniforms are further altered to showcase the power of femininity in the life of the professional. This collection is dedicated to my grandmother, Juanita Kling."
